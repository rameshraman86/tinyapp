# TinyApp Project

A fullstack multipage web app built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URL's. It has authentication protection and reacts appropriately to the user's logged-in state.

The app will permit users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) a simple entity (e.g. blog posts, URL shortener).
 The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.
